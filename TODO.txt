	Moar small test programs instead of a giant TestStuff
x		UI			basic esc menu, onscreen data like lists of assets in gamedir, something realtime like position or velocity
		Physics		setting up static floors and walls, loading static stuff, bouncing balls, stacking cubes
		Terrain		load and fly around a terrain chunk, maybe drop balls on it
		Characters	load and play anims with keys, simple ui instructions
		Audio		load and play sounds with simple ui
		Input		key binds?  controllers?  mouse sens?

	Easier window creation and gameloop
		Looked at raylib and the examples are so small and clean!
		Could do better at stuffing stuff like rast and viewport into libs somewhere

x	Build (using nob.h)
