Goals
	Basic convex terrain chunks
	Entity placement
	Integrate with pathing for generating navmesh data
	Raycast routines needed
		Ray
		RayRadius (swept sphere)
		RayCapsule (two spheres good enough)
		RayAxialBox? (tricksy with leafs)
		RayOrientedBox (very tricksy with leafs)
	TextureAtlas based shading
		Test textures
			Grassland
			Snow
			Rocky
			Forest Undergrowth
			Beachy sand for water areas
			Lava
			Cracked mud?
			Black rock?

Collision
	Initial non moving resolve into empty space
		Establish footing and do rotation
	AABB quadtree for nodes
		Fast reject, no accuracy needed
		Could do all 4 child nodes at once
	Leaf Nodes
		Big Tri collision best for current terrain
			Not so great if do diggery later
			Not so great if more detail
		Convex volumes
			Extra hits on fake side planes
			Complicates runtime editing and diggery
		2D bsp?
			faces might get split
	Octree for volumey / diggy diggy

BigMaps
	9 Heightmaps loaded?
	1 2 3
	4 5 6
	7 8 9
	Player/Camera in 5
	Stuff beyond the outers fogged out
	When player moves from 5 to 6, 1, 4, and 7 are marked to be unloaded
		Three more maps are streamed in
		After a tunable amount of time, 1,4,7 are unloaded
	If player moves from 5 to 3, then 1,4,7,8,9 all marked to be unloaded etc

Editing
	UV Scale factor of each atlas piece
	Vertical texturing for steep walls?
		Certain atlas parts could be reserved for vertical
	Place Heights to form a bigmap
	Paint/smooth the boundary between them
	Automated boundary test maybe?
