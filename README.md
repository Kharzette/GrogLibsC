# GrogLibsC
Game libraries using C language, often ported from my C# libraries of the same name.  This all sits atop dxvk-native and is only really working on linux64 that I know of.  I'll get around to testing a windows build one of these days.

# Working Stuff
- Animated character style meshes
- Really basic input
- Very simple terrain generation / rendering
- UI Module using [Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay)

# Not Working Stuff
- Terrain raycasts

# TODO
- BSP Maps
- Integration of a physics library of some sort
- Better collision / physics on characters
- Static meshes with various collision shapes
- Windows

# Building
For awhile I had every dependency as a submodule, but that made it annoying for people.  These packages should be installed:
- SDL2
- FAudio
- pnglib

The dxvk-native submodule needs building:
```bash
meson --buildtype "debug" build
cd build
ninja
```
Grog's makefiles will look for the libs there in dxvk-native/build/etc

So something really annoying I do that I should probably fix is using .vscode launch.json and tasks.json to copy the shared libraries around.  I should either commit those or stop doing that and have the makefiles do something more reasonable.
