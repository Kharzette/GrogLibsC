Goals
x	Basic convex terrain chunks
	Entity placement
	Octree for volumey / diggy diggy?
	Integrate with pathing for generating navmesh data
x	Raycast routines
	Test raycasts / movement between chunks
	TextureAtlas based shading
		Test textures
			Grassland
			Snow
			Rocky
			Forest Undergrowth
			Beachy sand for water areas
			Lava
			Cracked mud?
			Black rock?


Streaming BigMaps
	9 Heightmaps loaded?
	1 2 3
	4 5 6
	7 8 9
	Player/Camera in 5
	Stuff beyond the outers fogged out
	When player moves from 5 to 6, 1, 4, and 7 are marked to be unloaded
		Three more maps are streamed in
		After a tunable amount of time, 1,4,7 are unloaded
	If player moves from 5 to 3, then 1,4,7,8,9 all marked to be unloaded etc
	This is a single ring around the active chunk, should probably be 2

Editing
	UV Scale factor of each atlas piece
	Vertical texturing for steep walls?
		Certain atlas parts could be reserved for vertical
	Place Heights to form a bigmap
	Paint/smooth the boundary between them
	Automated boundary test maybe?
